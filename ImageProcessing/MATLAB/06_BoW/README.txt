1. Load any of "variables.mat", "variables.mat2", or "variables.mat3". Matrices after training are stored here.

2. Run `test` to test the implementation. It will show the confusion matrix.

3. Run `mutliTest` to test and display results as images.

4. Run `singleTest` to test individual test files. IMPORTANT: provide [category/filename] as input.
    e.g. input: accordion/image_0004.jpg

5. Only the 'testThreshold.m' contains functions necessary to test wheather an image does not belong to any class.
    run `testThreshold` to test with 64 unknown images.
